# euchre
NEAT (almost) for Euchre entirely (mostly?) in stack memory.

## TODO
- parallelize evolution
- agent populations / evolution / tournament
- decouple NeuralNetwork from euchre to support user player
- command line arguments / refactor main to be a tool
- tutor mode (asks for input, feed it in, tells you what it wants to do)
- play mode
